# E138 — Diagnostic Code 138

## Symptoms
- Synthetic industrial fault pattern 138 observed in the field.
- Repeated alarms reported by site operators

## Severity
high

## Likely Causes
- component wear
- environmental stress
- sensor offset

## Engineering Explanation
This code represents a field-observed pattern that should be validated against the asset configuration and connected sensor values.

## Repair Procedure
Inspect the assembly and confirm the expected range for code E138.

## Safety
- Isolate electrical power before service
- Follow refrigerant handling rules and site permit controls

## Affected Components
- Compressor
- Control Board
- Pressure Sensor
